        How many more people have to unjustly die at the hands of the police before there’s real change?
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with police brutality under a microscope after George Floyd’s death and the subsequent protests across the world,
        the police continue to abuse their power and terrorize civilians.

        <p>
          These are just a few of the 500+ documented police brutality incidents since George Floyd's death.
          The fact that there has been such an immense amount of police brutality at anti-police brutality protests highlights that there needs
          to be sweeping changes to policing in the U.S. That starts with defunding the police.

        >
          more than $100 billion
          </a>
        &nbsp;on policing per year. For most cities, police department budgets make up a&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/cops-cost-billions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          disproportionate amount
        </a>
        &nbsp;of overall spending, an asymmetry that’s deepened as other departments face&nbsp;
        <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/22/la-budget-nyc-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          steep cuts
        </a>
        &nbsp;due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        For example, from 2014-19,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21279214/nyc-defund-nypd-police-budget-affordable-housing-homelessness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          New York City spent
        </a>
        &nbsp;$41.1 billion on police and corrections while spending $9.9 billion on homeless
        services and $6.8 billion on housing preservation and development. If you combined the city’s spending on homelessness and housing
        and quadrupled it, that would still be less than what the city spent on policing and corrections.
      </p>
      <p>
        While defunding the police may sound like a radical statement to some, it isn’t if you dig into what it means.
        Defunding isn’t abolishment, it doesn’t equate to getting rid of cops or eliminating police budgets entirely.
        Defunding the police simply entails a restructuring of public spending: taking money away from the police and funneling it into
        community services like education and medical access. Empowering community services with much-needed, currently lacking resources
        for their responsibilities reduces police intervention in situations where the police isn’t really needed, like substance abuse
        disorders or mental health crises. Consequently, less police intervention means less violence and killings by cops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Defunding the police is about shifting public safety from relying on a narrow definition of policing and punishment to investing in
        services that are better equipped to advance and uphold community safety and care.&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.mpd150.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to MPD150</a>
        , instead of "strangers armed with guns, who very likely do not live in the neighborhoods they’re patrolling," it should be social
        workers, mental health care providers and victim or survivor advocates, among others, who address the problems police are called to
        handle. For example, when the Minneapolis City Council examined the&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protests-sunday/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          city's 911 logs,
        </a>
        &nbsp;it found most incidents required the fire department, EMTs, or mental-health professionals, not the police.
      </p>
      <p>
        When police are assigned to schools, drug overdoses, mental health crises, suicide calls, and homeless encampment issues, they aren’t
        equipped with the tools and training to isolate the problem from the people. Cops end up criminalizing people rather than addressing
        the real problem underlying a situation. An officer trained to see killing as "
        <a href="https://www.insider.com/bulletproof-dave-grossman-police-trainer-teaching-officers-how-to-kill-2020-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          not that big of a deal
        </a>
        " is more likely to choose a violent response rather than de-escalation tactics. Not to mention, police disproportionately&nbsp;

          use force against Black people,
        </a>
        &nbsp;and Black people are&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          more likely to be arrested and sentenced.
        </a>
        &nbsp;Plus, about half of the people killed by police had some
        kind of mental disability, according to a&nbsp;
        <a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MediaStudy-PoliceDisability_final-final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

        &nbsp;And, let’s not forget that that the&nbsp;

        Police reform has failed.
        Five years ago, in addressing the murders of&nbsp;

          Tamir Rice
        </a>
        , implicit bias training, community police encounter sessions, and body cameras were brought in to fix police brutality.
        Unfortunately, the body cameras have only shown that police brutality can be officially documented yet left un-checked.
        And the training only emphasizes that the deep-rooted, violent culture of law enforcement is incapable of change.
        Black Americans and other marginalized communities are&nbsp;
        <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still being disproportionately terrorized and killed by police</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some folks fear their safety is at risk if police presence is reduced. They forget that for many people the police is the real danger.
        The mindset that policing equals safety doesn’t always hold up. For example, a&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0211-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          2017 report
        </a>
        &nbsp;which focused on several weeks in 2014 through 2015 when the New York Police Department purposely pulled back on proactive policing (systematic and aggressive enforcement of low-level violations" and heightened police presence in areas where "crime is anticipated) found that there were 2,100 fewer crime complaints during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, it’s time to honor George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, and the countless other Black folks who have brutally
        lost their lives at the hands of the police. It’s time to invest in our communities. It’s time to defund the police.
